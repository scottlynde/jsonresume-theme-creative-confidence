# jsonresume-theme-creative-confidence

Creative Confidence is an ATS-friendly JSON Resume theme with a clean two-column layout, print-focused spacing, and strong visual hierarchy.

## Highlights

- Two-column resume layout with a prominent header and profile image block
- Print-friendly output for Letter-sized PDF export
- Contact section with compact icons and profile-specific social marks
- Visual emphasis tuned for readability (summary, section headings, bullets)
- No filesystem or network reads at render time (serverless-safe behavior)

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- JSON Resume CLI (`resume-cli`) or equivalent tooling

## Install

Install from npm:

```bash
npm install jsonresume-theme-creative-confidence
```

Or install in a project where you keep your resume data:

```bash
npm install jsonresume-theme-creative-confidence resume-cli
```

## Theme slug

Use this theme with the slug:

- `creative-confidence`

## CLI usage

If `resume` is globally installed:

```bash
resume validate resume.json
resume serve --theme creative-confidence
resume export output.pdf --theme creative-confidence
```

If you prefer `npx`:

```bash
npx resume-cli validate resume.json
npx resume-cli serve --theme creative-confidence
npx resume-cli export output.pdf --theme creative-confidence
```

## Programmatic usage

```js
import { render } from "jsonresume-theme-creative-confidence";
import resume from "./resume.json" assert { type: "json" };

const html = render(resume);
```

## Supported resume data

The theme is designed for standard JSON Resume schema sections and gracefully handles missing optional fields.

Primary sections rendered:

- basics (name, label, image, contact/profiles)
- work (position, organization, dates, summary, highlights)
- education (degree/area/institution, optional course bullets)
- certificates
- skills

## Print and compatibility notes

- Optimized for Letter page export via `resume export`
- Uses inline CSS generated by the theme renderer
- Avoids runtime file loading (`fs`, `__dirname`, network reads), aligning with JSON Resume serverless expectations

## Local development workflow

From this theme folder:

```bash
npm install
```

From a workspace that has `resume.json`:

```bash
npx resume-cli serve --theme creative-confidence
npx resume-cli export Creative-Confidence-theme-preview.pdf --theme creative-confidence
```

## Publishing checklist

Before publish:

1. Update `version` in `package.json`
2. Confirm README and screenshots are current
3. Verify `render(resume)` output with local `resume.json`

Publish:

```bash
npm login
npm publish --access public
```

Verify:

```bash
npm view jsonresume-theme-creative-confidence version
```
